    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "- MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you to work with that data very efficiently. It is categorized under the NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The MongoDB database is developed and managed by MongoDB.Inc under SSPL(Server Side Public License) and initially released in February 2009. It also provides official driver support for all the popular languages like C, C++, C#, and .Net, Go, Java, Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python, Motor, Ruby, Scala, Swift, Mongoid. So, that you can create an application using any of these languages. Nowadays there are so many companies that used MongoDB like Facebook, Nokia, eBay, Adobe, Google, etc. to store their large amount of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored. For example, data may be stored as simple key/value pairs, as JSON documents, or as a graph consisting of edges and vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- if your “data is unstructured and complex, or if you can’t pre-define your schema, you’d better opt for MongoDB.” And what is more, if you need to handle a large volume of data and store it as documents — MongoDB will help you to meet the challenges."

    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of MongoDB :\n",
    "- Schema-less. Like other NoSQL databases, MongoDB doesn't require predefined schemas. It stores any type of data. This gives users the flexibility to create any number of fields in a document, making it easier to scale MongoDB databases compared to relational databases.\n",
    "- Document-oriented. One of the advantages of using documents is that these objects map to native data types in several programming languages., Having embedded documents also reduces the need for database joins, which can lower costs.\n",
    "- Scalability. A core function of MongoDB is its horizontal scalability, which makes it a useful database for companies running big data applications. In addition, sharding lets the database distribute data across a cluster of machines. MongoDB also supports the creation of zones of data based on a shard key.\n",
    "- Third-party support. MongoDB supports several storage engines and provides pluggable storage engine APIs that let third parties develop their own storage engines for MongoDB.\n",
    "- Aggregation. The DBMS also has built-in aggregation capabilities, which lets users run MapReduce code directly on the database rather than running MapReduce on Hadoop. MongoDB also includes its own file system called GridFS, akin to the Hadoop Distributed File System. The use of the file system is primarily for storing files larger than BSON's size limit of 16 MB per document. These similarities let MongoDB be used instead of Hadoop, though the database software does integrate with Hadoop, Spark and other data processing frameworks.\n",

    "### Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, find() method is used to select documents in a collection and return a cursor to the selected documents. Cursor means a pointer that points to a document, when we use find() method it returns a pointer on the selected documents and returns one by one. If we want to return pointer on all documents then use empty() parameter that returns all documents one by one. It takes only some optional parameters. The first optional parameter is the selection criteria on which we want to return a cursor. To return all documents in a collection use empty document({}). Using this method you can also replace embedded documents. You can also use this method in multi-document transactions. If you use this method in the mongo shell, then the shell will automatically iterate the cursor to display up to 20 documents in the collection, if you want to continue then type it or you can manually iterate the result of the find() method by assigning the returned cursor to a variable with the var keyword. You can also modify the behavior of this method using cursor methods.\n",

    "selection_criteria: It specifies selection criteria. To return all documents in a collection use empty document({}). The type of this parameter is document.\n",
    "projection: It specifies the fields to return in the documents that match the selection criteria. To return all fields in the matching documents, remove this parameter. It is of the document type.\n",
    "options: It specifies some additional options for the selection_criteria parameter. It modifies the behavior of selection_criteria and also affects the results that will be returned.\n",
    "This document takes:\n",
    "\n",
    "{ field1: <value1>, field2: <value2> ... }\n",
