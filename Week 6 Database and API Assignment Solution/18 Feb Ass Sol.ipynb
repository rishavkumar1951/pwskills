    "### Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is a communication interface that allows two separate software components to share data. An API operates as a bridge between internal and external software operations, allowing for a fluid interchange of data that frequently passes undetected by the end-user. Simply said, an API acts as a virtual middleman, transferring data from one interface, such as a mobile app, to another. APIs connect various sections of a software platform to guarantee that information is sent correctly. These connection points serve as an internal communication route, and a way for external tools to access the same data. As a result, APIs may be classified into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Private APIs: A private API is only available to developers and users within a company. These APIs are often used to link internal team operations to remove silos and streamline communication.\n",
    "- Open APIs: On the other hand, open APIs allow third-party developers to quickly access and merge data from one tool to another. An open or public API saves time for developers by allowing them to link their platform with already existing tools, minimizing the need to construct new services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data is a popular API example that we come across regularly. Rich weather snippets appear ubiquitous, appearing on all platforms such as Google Search, Apple's Weather app, and even your smart home device.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you Google \"weather + [your city's name],\" you'll get a specialized box at the top of the search results (known as a rich snippet) containing the current weather conditions and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google isn't in the weather data business (yet!), so they get it from a third party. They do it using an API, which feeds them the most recent meteorological information in a format that they can easily modify. As previously stated, several weather APIs power this type of functionality."

    "### Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "- Increased Interoperability: API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their programming language or platform. This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange of data and functionality.\n",
    "- Improved Efficiency: API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "- Better User Experience: APIs can enable third-party developers to create applications that integrate with existing software systems, providing a better user experience and increased functionality.\n",
    "- Increased Flexibility: APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming languages and frameworks for their needs.\n",
    "- New Revenue Streams: APIs can enable companies to create new revenue streams by providing third-party developers with access to their software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Security Concerns: API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "- Complexity: APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "- Compatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or between different systems, which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "Dependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications that integrate with the software system. This can create dependencies that are outside of the control of the company that owns the software system.\n",
    "- Governance and Management: APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly and consistently across different applications and systems."

    "### Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a collection of communication conventions and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them. A developer can utilize different API apparatuses to make its program simpler and less complex. Likewise, an API encourages the developers with a proficient method to build up their product programs. Thus, in simple terms, an API determines how programming segments ought to associate with one another. It is a set of protocols and schedules, and its reactions are returned as JSON or XML in data. APIs can utilize any kind of communication convention and are not restricted similarly as a web service is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web API\n",
    "- APIs are application interfaces, implying that one application can communicate with another application in a standardized manner.\n",
    "- API is used for any style of communication.\n",
    "- APIs are not web services.\n",
    "- It has a light-weight architecture furthermore, useful for gadgets which have constrained transmission capacity like smart phones.\n",
    "- It provides support for the HTTP/s protocol: URL Request/Response Headers, and so on.\n",
    "- It is an open source and also ships with .NET framework.\n",
    "- API supports XML and JSON.\n",
    "- Web API can be hosted only on IIS and self.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Web services are a type of API, which must be accessed through a network connection.\n",
    "- Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication.\n",
    "- All Web services are APIs.\n",
    "- It doesn’t have lightweight design, needs a SOAP convention to send or receive data over the system.\n",
    "- It provides supports only for the HTTP protocol.\n",
    "- It is not open source, however, can be devoured by any customer that comprehends xml.\n",
    "- Web service supports only XML.\n",

    "### Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-soap-rest/#:~:text=SOAP%20and%20REST%20are%20two%20different%20approaches%20to%20API%20design,exchange%20data%20in%20multiple%20formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SOAP and REST are two internet data exchange mechanisms. For example, imagine that your internal accounts system shares data with your customer's accounting system to automate invoicing tasks. The two applications share data by using an API that defines communication rules. SOAP and REST are two different approaches to API design. The SOAP approach is highly structured and uses XML data format. REST is more flexible and allows applications to exchange data in multiple formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SOAP is an older technology that requires a strict communication contract between systems. New web service standards have been added over time to accommodate technology changes, but they create additional overheads. REST was developed after SOAP and inherently solves many of its shortcomings. REST web services are also called RESTful web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SOAP APIs\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol that defines rigid communication rules. It has several associated standards that control every aspect of the data exchange. For example, here are some standards SOAP uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web Services Security (WS-Security) specifies security measures like using unique identifiers called tokens\n",
    "- Web Services Addressing (WS-Addressing) requires including routing information as metadata\n",
    "- WS-ReliableMessaging standardizes error handling in SOAP messaging\n",
    "- Web Services Description Language (WSDL) describes the scope and function of SOAP web services\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send a request to a SOAP API, you must wrap your HTTP request in a SOAP envelope. This is a data structure that modifies the underlying HTTP content with SOAP request requirements. Due to the envelope, you can also send requests to SOAP web services with other transport protocols, like TCP or Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). However, SOAP APIs and SOAP web services always return XML documents in their responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### REST APIs\n",
    "REST is a software architectural style that imposes six conditions on how an API should work. These are the six principles REST APIs follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Client-server architecture. The sender and receiver are independent of each other regarding technology, platforming, programming language, and so on.\n",
    "- Layered. The server can have several intermediaries that work together to complete client requests, but they are invisible to the client.\n",
    "- Uniform interface. The API returns data in a standard format that is complete and fully useable.\n",
    "- Stateless. The API completes every new request independently of previous requests.\n",
    "- Cacheable. All API responses are cacheable.\n",
    "- Code on demand. The API response can include a code snippet if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "You send REST requests using HTTP verbs like GET and POST. Rest API responses are typically in JSON but can also be of a different data format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### shortcomings of SOAP\n",
    "- Resource-consuming. Due to the larger size of an XML-file and a payload created by the massive structure of a message, a SOAP API requires a larger bandwidth. Sometimes, this trade-off isn’t worth dealing with. Simply put, it’s slow to process these strings of tags that XML messages abound with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hard learning curve. Being protocol-based, building SOAP API servers requires knowledge and understanding of all protocols you may use with it. Developers dealing with building these types of APIs should dive deep into all processes inside the protocol with its highly restricted rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lacks flexibility. We’ve mentioned that a SOAP API serves as a strict contract between a client and a server. With this in mind, this rigid SOAP schema requires additional effort to add or remove the message properties on both sides of the communication, the server and the client. It makes updating requests and responses a tedious process and slows down adoption."
