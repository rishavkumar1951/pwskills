    "\"\"\" Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. That enables the user to implement even more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden background/back-end complexity. \"\"\"\n",
    "\"\"\" Abstract Base Classes\n",
    "An abstract base class is the common application program of the interface for a set of subclasses. It can be used by the third-party, which will provide the implementations such as with plugins. It is also beneficial when we work with the large code-base hard to remember all the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working of the Abstract Classes\n",
    "Unlike the other high-level language, Python doesn't provide the abstract class itself. We need to import the abc module, which provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes (ABC). The ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract. It registers concrete classes as the implementation of the abstract base. We use the @abstractmethod decorator to define an abstract method or if we don't provide the definition to the method, it automatically becomes the abstract method. Let's understand the following example.  \"\"\"\n",
