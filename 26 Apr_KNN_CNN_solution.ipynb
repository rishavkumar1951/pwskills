    "# Assignment: PCA Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    " Objective:\n",
    " The objective of this assignment is to implement PCA on a given dataset and analyse the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "- Download the wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). \n",
    "- Load the dataset into a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "- Split the dataset into features and target variables.\n",
    "- Perform data preprocessing (e.g., scaling, normalisation, missing value imputation) as necessary.\n",
    "- Implement PCA on the preprocessed dataset using the scikit-learn library.\n",
    "- Determine the optimal number of principal components to retain based on the explained variance ratio.\n",
    "- Visualise the results of PCA using a scatter plot.\n",
    "- Perform clustering on the PCA-transformed data using K-Means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "- Interpret the results of PCA and clustering analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "- Jupyter notebook containing the code for the PCA implementation.\n",
    "- A report summarising the results of PCA and clustering analysis.\n",
    "- Scatter plot showing the results of PCA.\n",
    "- A table showing the performance metrics for the clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Information:\n",
    "- You can use the python programming language.\n",
    "- You can use any other machine learning libraries or tools as necessary.\n",
    "- You can use any visualisation libraries or tools as necessary."
