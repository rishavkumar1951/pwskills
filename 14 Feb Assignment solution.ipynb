    "Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. This is termed context switching. In context switching, the state of a thread is saved and the state of another thread is loaded whenever any interrupt (due to I/O or manually set) takes place. Context switching takes place so frequently that all the threads appear to be running parallelly (this is termed multitasking).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance.\n",

    "As shown in the diagram, two persons are trying to deposit 1 dollar online into the same bank account. The initial amount is 17 dollar. Both the persons would be able to see $17 initially. Each of them tries to deposit $1, and the final amount is expected to be $19. But due to race conditions, the final amount in the bank is $18 instead of $19. This is also known as dirty read.\n",

Neither of them will be able to accomplish its task, as they keep waiting for the other resources they need.\n",

    "As you can see in the second diagram, process 1 is waiting for process 2 and process 2 is waiting for process 3 to finish and process 3 is waiting for process 1 to finish. All these three processes would keep waiting and will never end. This is called deadlock."
